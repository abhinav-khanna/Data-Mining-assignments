Procedure:

Since all the code is provided in Jupyter Notebook, you can easily run the code by running each cell sequentially. 
All notebooks are labeled in the format "<Algorithm>-<Dataset>.ipynb". 
Please ensure that the dataset files are in the same folder as the notebooks
Note: For running FP tree algorithm, a new file "<Dataset>_sorted.txt" is created. This file SHOULD BE EMPTY BEFORE EXECUTION, as the file is written/created in append mode
